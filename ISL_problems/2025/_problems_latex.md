## A1  (Czech Republic)

Quadratic solitaire is a single-player game. To start the game, the player chooses two distinct nonzero integers $a$ and $b$ and writes the equation
\[
x^2+ax+b=0
\]
on a blackboard. On each turn, if the equation currently written on the blackboard has two distinct nonzero integer solutions $x=u$ and $x=v$, then the player erases the equation and replaces it by one of the equations
\[
x^2+ux+v=0 \qquad\text{or}\qquad x^2+vx+u=0
\]
of their choosing. Otherwise, the game ends.

Determine all initial choices of $a$ and $b$ such that quadratic solitaire can be played forever.

## A2  (China)

The sunshine cost of a sequence $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{100}$ of integers is the largest possible value of
\[
\left|(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_i)-a_j\right|
\]
as $i$ and $j$ vary over all integers $1,2,\ldots,100$.

Determine the smallest possible sunshine cost over all sequences $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{100}$ of pairwise distinct integers.

## A3  (Italy)

Coral and Joey are playing the inekoalaty game, a two-player game whose rules depend on a positive real number $\lambda$ which is known to both players. On the $n$th turn of the game, the following happens:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $n$ is odd, Coral chooses a nonnegative real number $x_n$ such that
\[
x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n\leq \lambda n.
\]
\item If $n$ is even, Joey chooses a nonnegative real number $x_n$ such that
\[
x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2\leq n.
\]
\end{itemize}
All chosen numbers are known to both players. If a player cannot make a move, the game ends and the other player wins.

Determine all values of $\lambda$ for which Coral has a winning strategy and all those for which Joey has a winning strategy.

## A4  (Mongolia)

Let $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ be the set of all nonnegative integers. Let $f:\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}\to\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ be an unbounded function such that, if $m$ and $n$ are nonnegative integers satisfying
\[
f(m+n)=\max\{f(0),f(1),\ldots,f(m+n)\},
\]
then
\[
f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n).
\]
Prove that there exist positive integers $A,B,C$ and $D$ such that, for all nonnegative integers $n$,
\[
f(An+B)=Cn+D.
\]

We say that $f$ is unbounded if for each nonnegative integer $N$, there exists some nonnegative integer $n$ such that $f(n)\geq N$.

## A5  (Thailand)

Determine all integers $n\geq 2$ such that the polynomial
\[
P(x,y,z)=x^n+y^n+z^n-x^{n-2}yz-xy^{n-2}z-xyz^{n-2}
\]
can be written as $P(x,y,z)=Q(x,y,z)R(x,y,z)$, where $Q(x,y,z)$ and $R(x,y,z)$ are nonconstant polynomials with integer coefficients.

## A6  (Singapore)

Let $S$ be a set of positive integers, possibly infinite, such that no positive integer greater than $1$ divides all elements of $S$. Determine all non-periodic infinite sequences $a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots$ of positive integers such that, for all positive integers $n$,
\begin{itemize}
\item $a_n\leq |a_{n+\ell}-\ell|$ for all $\ell$ in $S$, and
\item $a_n=|a_{n+\ell}-\ell|$ for at least one $\ell$ in $S$.
\end{itemize}
We say that an infinite sequence $a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots$ is periodic if there exists a positive integer $t$ such that $a_n=a_{n+t}$ for all positive integers $n$.

## A7  (Thailand)

For each integer $k\geq 3$, prove that there exists a unique tuple $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k)$ of positive real numbers such that $x_1\geq x_2\geq\cdots\geq x_k$ and
\[
\left\lfloor nx_1+\frac12\right\rfloor+
\left\lfloor nx_2+\frac12\right\rfloor+\cdots+
\left\lfloor nx_k+\frac12\right\rfloor=n
\]
for every integer $n$.

Here $\lfloor z\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $z$. For example, $\lfloor-\pi\rfloor=-4$ and $\lfloor2\rfloor=\lfloor2.9\rfloor=2$.

## A8  (France)

Tim and Tam play a game. To start the game, Tim writes some nonzero real numbers, not necessarily distinct, on a blackboard. In each round, the following happens:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, Tam chooses a polynomial
\[
P_k(x)=a_kx^k+a_{k-1}x^{k-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0
\]
whose coefficients $a_k,a_{k-1},\ldots,a_1,a_0$ are all of the numbers currently written on the blackboard in some order. (For example, if the numbers on the blackboard are $4,-3,4$, then $k=2$ and Tam may choose the polynomial $4x^2-3x+4$ or $-3x^2+4x+4$ but not $4x-3$ or $-3x^2-3x+4$.)
\item Then, if the equation $P_k(x)=0$ has no real solutions, the game is stopped. Otherwise, Tim chooses a real number $r$ such that $P_k(r)=0$ and writes it on the blackboard, so there is now one more number on the blackboard.
\end{itemize}
Determine whether Tim can ensure that the game is never stopped, no matter what Tam does.

## C1  (U.S.A.)

Let $n\geq 3$ be an integer, and let $S_n$ be the set of points $(x,y)$ in the plane such that $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative integers and $x+y<n$. A line in the plane is called interesting if it is not parallel to the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, or the line $x+y=0$.

Determine all nonnegative integers $k$ such that there exist $n$ lines satisfying both of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item the union of the $n$ lines contains every point of $S_n$, and
\item exactly $k$ of the lines are interesting.
\end{itemize}

## C2  (Colombia)

There is a row of $n$ paddocks, labelled from left to right with the integers $1$ to $n$, where $n\geq 3$. Skippy the Kangaroo grazes in the paddocks according to the following rule:

If Skippy is grazing in paddock $k$, then she makes a sequence of $k$ hops from a paddock to an adjacent paddock. The first of the $k$ hops is always to the right, unless Skippy is in paddock $n$, in which case it is to the left. Each of the following $k-1$ hops is in the same direction as the previous hop, unless Skippy is in paddock $1$ or $n$. Skippy grazes in the paddock that she is in after the $k$th hop.

For example, if $n=8$ and Skippy is grazing in paddock $3$, then the next four paddocks she grazes in are $6,4,8$ and $2$, in this order.

Skippy continues grazing in this way indefinitely. A paddock is overgrazed if Skippy eventually grazes in it, regardless of the paddock that she starts in. Determine all $n\geq 3$ for which there is exactly one overgrazed paddock.

## C3  (Islamic Republic of Iran)

There are $2025$ white balls and $2025$ black balls arranged in a row. A balanced segment is a contiguous nonempty segment of balls that contains the same number of white balls as black balls. A balanced removal is the operation of selecting a balanced segment $S$, removing all the balls in $S$, and shifting left the balls that were to the right of $S$ so that the remaining balls form a contiguous row.

Determine the smallest positive integer $N$ satisfying the following property: for every configuration of balls and for every integer $k$ satisfying $0\leq k\leq 2025$, there exists a sequence of at most $N$ balanced removals after which there are exactly $2k$ remaining balls.

## C4  (China)

Bluey is placing lollies on a $1000\times1000$ grid. Initially, every cell of the grid is empty.

If there is no such row or column, Bluey stops.

Determine the maximum number of lollies that Bluey can place.
